# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use markup language created by John Gruber in 2004. Its main goal is to convert plain text into HTML in a simple and intuitive way. It is widely used on platforms like GitHub, blogs, project documentation, and much more.

## Features of Markdown

1. **Simple Syntax**:
   - Markdown uses a minimalist syntax that is easy to read and write, even without rendering.

2. **HTML Conversion**:
   - Markdown can be automatically converted to HTML, simplifying the creation of web content.

3. **Cross-Platform**:
   - It can be used in various editors, version control systems, and websites.

## Markdown Syntax Examples

### Headings

- To create headings, use the `#` character followed by the text. The number of `#` determines the heading level:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Emphasis Text

- **Bold**: Use double asterisks (`**`) or underscores (`__`) around the text.
- *Italic*: Use a single asterisk (`*`) or underscores (`_`) around the text.

```markdown
**Bold** or __Bold__
*Italic* or _Italic_
```

### Lists

- **Ordered**: Use numbers followed by a period.
- **Unordered**: Use hyphens (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`).

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item

- Item A
- Item B
```

### Links

- To create links, use the format `[text](URL)`.

```markdown
[Visit GitHub](https://github.com)
```

### Images

- To add images, use the format `![alt text](image URL)`.

```markdown
![Markdown Logo](https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png)
```

### Code

- To highlight code, use single backticks for inline code or triple backticks for code blocks.

```markdown
`console.log('Hello, Markdown!')`
```

Code block:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello, Markdown!');
}
```
